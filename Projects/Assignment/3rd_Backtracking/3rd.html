    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with number of options,and must choose one of these. After make your
        choice you will get a new set of options, just what set fo options you get depends on what choice you made. This
        procedure is replaced over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your
        final state is goal state; if you din't it isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptuallly, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probable has some good leaves and some more bad leaves,
        through it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf, At each node,
        beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a
        leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for food leaf by revoking your most
        recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options if you run out of options, revoke the
        choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. if you end op at the root with no options left,
        there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <p>This neads an example.</p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, And it failed. Try D</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B</li>
        <li>At B, you options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. the tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices
        we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell
        us what choices we have. (if we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first
        tree searching.)</p>
    <h4>The backtracking algorithm.</h4>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>Notice that a algorithm is expressed as a boolean funciton. This is essential to understanding the algorithim. If
        solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path form
        the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes
        n to an goal node.</p>
    <h5>How does this work?</h5>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>IF any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is
        test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this
        is done by the lines.</p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. if the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if
        the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by
        the lines</p>
    <pre class="code">
        if n is a leaf node {
         if the leaf is a goal node, return true
         else return false
        }
    </pre>
    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it to thoroughly. Another way of
        stating it is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To search a tree</li>
        <ul type="1">
            <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is goal node.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched
                them all unsuccessfully.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
    <p>Backtracking is rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In
        fact, that is how your recursice algorithms are translated into machine or assemble language.</p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>Starting form the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently
        on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all
        times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed form the stack only when it is known that they have
        no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there
        must have been no goa nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.</p>
    <p>When the stack algorithm terminated successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the
        root to a goal node.</p>
    <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in
        the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by
        (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in any array.</p>
    <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slighly to print (in reverse order) the nodes alond the
        successful path:</p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
    <p>All of those versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they
        can get pretty cluttered up with details, Even determining whether the node is leaf can be complex:</p>
    <p>for example, if the path represents a series fo moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate
        and stalemate solutions</p>
    <p>To keep the program cleanm, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example,
        you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b>(or you could even call it
        <b>isLeaf</b> ). This mehtod would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves
        remain.
    </p>
    <p>Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its
        children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look
        simple, by just saying <b>for each child c of n.</b>In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the
        possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can
        represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement
        after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones
        you've already examined?</p>
    <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon
        initial entry to the node (taht is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As
        you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and
        you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.</p>
    <p>There is an easier way to keep track fo which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the
        children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try
        next.</p>
    <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then,
        if you have just tried <b>child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1 </b>and
        you have not yet tried children <b>k+1</b> through n. Or if you are trying to color a may with just four colors,
        you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b>If the child yellow fails, you know to
        try child green next. if you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <b>
            (or perhaps north, east, south, west).</b></p>
    <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. In the chess game example, you might
        number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each
        piece may also have several moves, and these must also beordered.</p>
    <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
    <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example fo backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will
        also use the simplest king of tree, a binary tree. A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node
        is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to) zero, one or two other nodes, which are
        called its children. The children are referred to as athe left child and/or the right child. All nodes are
        reachable(by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles, for our purposes, althought this is
        not pat of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will
        contain its name. The first example in the paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p>
    <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, And in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above
        binary tree.</p>
    <pre>
        static BinaryTree makeTree(){
        BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
        c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
        d = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
        e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
        f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
        a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
        b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
        root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
        retrun root;
        }
</pre>
    <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
    <pre>
        public static void main(String args[]){
         BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
         System.out.println(solvable(tree));
        }
</pre>
    <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
    <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
        /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false;
        /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
        /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) retrun true;
        /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) retrun true;
        /* 5 */ return false;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>Here's What the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ul type="1">
        <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the
            children of a node, without first cheching whether those children actually exist.</li>
        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, retrun success.</li>
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, cunclude that node is solvable. We will only get to
            this line if node is no-null and is not a goal node, says to</li>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This program runs correctly and produces the un enlightening result true.</p>
    <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null, In the above we put that check as the first
        thind in solvable. An alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do.
        Here's that alternative version:</p>
    <pre>
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
        if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
        if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) retrun true;
        if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) retrun true;
        return false;
    }
</pre>
    <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
    <h3>What are the children?</h3>
    <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all
        the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as
        you know, both the left adn the right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able
        to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.</p>
    <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. it is theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane,
        no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries
        that share a border are the same color.</p>
    <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, untill
        all countries are colored.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When your run out of countries, check whether you
            are at a goal node.</li>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent coutry, and recur. If and
            when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable;
        after all, a checkerboard onluy needs two colors.</p>
    <h6>boolean maplsOK()</h6>
    <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p>
    <h6>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</h6>
    <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
    </p>
    <h6>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</h6>
    <p>Used by both methods to find the next "country"</p>
    <ul type="none">
